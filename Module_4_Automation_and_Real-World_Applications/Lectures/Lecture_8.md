## 4. Practical Application:
### Real-World Example: Chelsea F.C. Performance Analytics
Chelsea F.C. employs wearable devices that collect data on players' movements during training sessions. This data is analyzed using automation techniques to provide insights into player fitness and strategy optimization.

### Code Snippet Example:
Here’s a simple Python snippet demonstrating how to automate data collection from a hypothetical API that provides player performance metrics:

```python
import requests

def fetch_player_data(player_id):
    url = f'https://api.chelseafc.com/player/{player_id}/performance'
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return None

# Example usage
player_data = fetch_player_data(10)  # Fetch data for player with ID 10
print(player_data)
```

## 5. Summary:
