### Example 5: Writing Complex Queries in Snowflake for Data Analysis

#### 1. Introduction
In this section, we will explore the significance of writing complex queries in Snowflake, particularly in the context of Robotics, semiconductors, and consumer electronics. As discussed in Lecture 5, understanding Snowflake's architecture is essential for leveraging its capabilities in data analysis.

Snowflake's cloud-native architecture allows organizations to efficiently manage and analyze large datasets. In industries such as robotics and consumer electronics, data analytics plays a crucial role in optimizing product performance, understanding consumer behavior, and enhancing operational efficiencies. For instance, by analyzing sensor data from robotic devices or performance metrics from semiconductor manufacturing processes, companies can make informed decisions that drive innovation and improve product quality.

#### 2. Code Snippet
Below is a well-commented SQL code snippet that illustrates how to write complex queries in Snowflake for data analysis. This example builds upon the concepts discussed in Lecture 5.

```sql
-- Create a database for storing sensor data from robotic devices
CREATE DATABASE robotics_data;
USE DATABASE robotics_data;

-- Create a table to store sensor readings
CREATE TABLE sensor_readings (
    device_id INT,
    reading_date TIMESTAMP,
    temperature FLOAT,
    humidity FLOAT,
    pressure FLOAT
);

-- Insert sample data into the sensor_readings table
INSERT INTO sensor_readings VALUES 
(1, '2023-10-01 08:00:00', 22.5, 45.0, 1013.0),
(1, '2023-10-01 09:00:00', 23.0, 44.5, 1012.8),
(2, '2023-10-01 08:00:00', 21.0, 50.0, 1014.0),
(2, '2023-10-01 09:00:00', 21.5, 49.5, 1013.5);

-- Query to analyze average temperature and humidity by device
SELECT 
    device_id,
    AVG(temperature) AS avg_temperature,
    AVG(humidity) AS avg_humidity
FROM 
    sensor_readings
GROUP BY 
    device_id
ORDER BY 
    device_id;
```

#### 3. Explanation
Let's break down the code step-by-step:

1. **Database Creation**: We first create a database named `robotics_data` to store our sensor data.
2. **Table Creation**: The `sensor_readings` table is created with columns for `device_id`, `reading_date`, `temperature`, `humidity`, and `pressure`. This structure allows us to capture essential metrics from robotic devices.
3. **Data Insertion**: Sample data is inserted into the table to simulate real sensor readings from two devices over time.
4. **Query Execution**: The final query calculates the average temperature and humidity for each device using the `AVG()` function. The results are grouped by `device_id` and ordered accordingly.

This SQL snippet demonstrates how to structure data and write queries that provide insights into device performance, which is crucial in the fields of robotics and consumer electronics.

#### 4. Application
A real-world application of this concept can be found in smart home robotics, where devices continuously collect environmental data to optimize their performance. For instance, a robotic vacuum cleaner can monitor temperature and humidity levels in different rooms to adjust its cleaning patterns accordingly.

By analyzing the data collected from various sensors through complex queries in Snowflake, manufacturers can enhance their products' efficiency and user experience. Additionally, insights gained from this data can lead to predictive maintenance strategies, reducing downtime and improving overall reliability.
