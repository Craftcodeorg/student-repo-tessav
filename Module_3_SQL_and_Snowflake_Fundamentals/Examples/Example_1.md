# Module Title: SQL and Snowflake Fundamentals

## Example 1: Basic SELECT Query Example

### 1. Introduction
In the context of the lecture titled **"Introduction to Databases and SQL,"** we explored the significance of databases in various industries, including Robotics, semiconductors, and consumer electronics. The ability to write basic SQL queries, such as the SELECT statement, is crucial for professionals in these fields as it allows them to efficiently retrieve and manipulate data stored in databases.

For instance, in Robotics, databases can be used to track sensor data, component inventories, and performance metrics of robotic systems. In the semiconductor industry, they are essential for managing production data and quality control metrics. Similarly, in consumer electronics, databases help manage customer information, product specifications, and sales data. Mastering SQL empowers professionals to analyze this data effectively, leading to better decision-making and innovation.

### 2. Code Snippet
Here’s a well-commented SQL code snippet that illustrates a basic SELECT query example:

```sql
-- Connect to the database
-- Assuming we are using a connection string
-- Example: connection = connect_to_database('database_name', 'username', 'password')

-- Define the SQL query to retrieve player names from Chelsea F.C. who scored more than 10 goals
SELECT name 
FROM players 
WHERE team = 'Chelsea' AND goals > 10;

-- Handle potential errors
BEGIN TRY
    -- Execute the query
    EXECUTE QUERY;
    PRINT 'Query executed successfully.';
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    -- Handle any errors that occur during execution
    PRINT 'Error occurred: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
```

### 3. Explanation
- **Connection to the Database**: The first step involves establishing a connection to the database where the players' data is stored. This is done using a hypothetical function `connect_to_database()`, which would require the database name, username, and password.
  
- **SQL Query**: The SELECT statement retrieves names of players from the `players` table who belong to Chelsea F.C. and have scored more than 10 goals in a season. The query uses a WHERE clause to filter results based on team affiliation and performance metrics.

- **Error Handling**: The code includes a TRY-CATCH block to handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the query. If an error occurs, it will print an error message instead of crashing the program.

This code snippet illustrates how professionals can use SQL to extract meaningful insights from data, which is particularly relevant in Robotics for analyzing performance metrics or in semiconductors for assessing production efficiency.

### 4. Application
A real-world application of this concept can be seen in the Robotics industry where companies use databases to manage data from robotic sensors. For example, consider a manufacturing robot that collects data on its operational efficiency—such as the number of tasks completed or errors encountered. By using SQL queries similar to the one above, engineers can retrieve specific performance metrics from a database.

This allows them to identify which robots are underperforming (e.g., those completing fewer tasks than expected) and take necessary actions such as recalibrating sensors or updating software. This not only improves operational efficiency but also reduces downtime and maintenance costs, ultimately enhancing productivity in manufacturing processes.
