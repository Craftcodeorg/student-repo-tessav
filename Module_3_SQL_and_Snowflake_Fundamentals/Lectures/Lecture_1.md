# Lecture 1: Introduction to Databases and SQL

## 1. Learning Objectives:
By the end of this lecture, learners will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of databases and SQL.
- Recognize the importance of databases in various industries, including sports.
- Write basic SQL queries to interact with a database.

## 2. Introduction:
Databases are essential tools that allow us to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently. In todayâ€™s data-driven world, understanding how databases work and how to interact with them using SQL (Structured Query Language) is crucial for anyone looking to excel in technology fields, including AI and software development.

For someone interested in Premier League Soccer, such as Chelsea F.C. fans, databases play a significant role in managing player statistics, match data, and fan engagement analytics. Mastering SQL will empower you to analyze this data effectively, ultimately aiding in your career goal of mastering data structures and algorithms (DSA) and optimizing Python code.

## 3. Core Concepts:
### What is a Database?
- A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Think of it as a digital filing cabinet.

### Types of Databases:
- **Relational Databases**: Use tables to store data and establish relationships between them (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **NoSQL Databases**: Use different data models (e.g., document, key-value) for unstructured data (e.g., MongoDB).

### Introduction to SQL:
- SQL is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. It allows users to perform tasks such as querying data, updating records, and creating new tables.

### Basic SQL Commands:
1. **SELECT**: Retrieve data from a database.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM players WHERE team = 'Chelsea';
   ```
2. **INSERT**: Add new records to a table.
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO players (name, position) VALUES ('New Player', 'Forward');
   ```
3. **UPDATE**: Modify existing records.
   ```sql
   UPDATE players SET position = 'Midfielder' WHERE name = 'Old Player';
   ```
4. **DELETE**: Remove records from a table.
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM players WHERE name = 'Retired Player';
   ```

## 4. Practical Application:
In the context of Premier League Soccer, consider how Chelsea F.C. might use a database to track player performance. For example, they could store player statistics such as goals scored, assists, and minutes played in a database.

### Example Scenario:
Imagine you want to find out which players scored more than 10 goals in a season. You could use the following SQL query:
```sql
SELECT name FROM players WHERE goals > 10;
```
This query retrieves the names of all players who have scored more than 10 goals, allowing coaches and analysts to make informed decisions.

## 5. Summary:
In this lecture, we introduced the concepts of databases and SQL. Key takeaways include understanding what a database is, the different types of databases, and basic SQL commands that allow you to interact with relational databases. These skills are foundational as you continue your journey toward mastering DSA and optimizing your coding abilities.

## 6. Next Steps:
In our next lecture, we will dive deeper into relational database design and normalization techniques, which are essential for creating efficient databases. To prepare, consider exploring examples of database structures used in sports analytics or reviewing the SQL commands introduced today. This will provide a solid foundation for our upcoming discussions.
