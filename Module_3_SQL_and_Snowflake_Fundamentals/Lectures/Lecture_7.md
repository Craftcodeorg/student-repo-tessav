# Lecture 7: Querying Data in Snowflake

### 1. Learning Objectives:
By the end of this lecture, learners will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of querying data in Snowflake.
- Execute basic SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data within Snowflake.
- Apply filtering, sorting, and limiting techniques to refine query results.
- Recognize the importance of efficient querying in data analysis and its relevance to career goals in databases and AI technologies.

### 2. Introduction:
Querying data is a crucial skill in the realm of databases and data analysis. In this lecture, we will explore how to effectively query data in Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing solution that is becoming increasingly popular in the tech industry. Understanding how to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently is essential for mastering data structures and algorithms (DSA), optimizing Python code, and strengthening your knowledge of databases.

Moreover, as a fan of Chelsea F.C., you can appreciate the importance of data analytics in sports. Teams utilize data to analyze player performance, game strategies, and even fan engagement. By mastering querying techniques, you can contribute to similar data-driven decisions in your future career.

### 3. Core Concepts:
#### A. Basics of Querying in Snowflake
- **SELECT Statement**: The foundation of querying data. It allows you to specify which columns you want to retrieve from a table.
  - Example: `SELECT player_name, goals FROM soccer_stats;`

#### B. Filtering Data with WHERE Clause
- Use the `WHERE` clause to filter records based on specific conditions.
  - Example: `SELECT player_name FROM soccer_stats WHERE goals > 10;`

#### C. Sorting Results with ORDER BY
- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results based on one or more columns.
  - Example: `SELECT player_name, goals FROM soccer_stats ORDER BY goals DESC;`

#### D. Limiting Results with LIMIT
- Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the number of records returned by your query.
  - Example: `SELECT player_name FROM soccer_stats ORDER BY goals DESC LIMIT 5;`

### 4. Practical Application:
In the context of Premier League Soccer, let's consider how querying can be applied. For instance, if Chelsea F.C. wants to analyze their top-performing players based on goals scored, they could run the following query:

```sql
SELECT player_name, goals 
FROM soccer_stats 
WHERE team = 'Chelsea F.C.' 
ORDER BY goals DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```
This query retrieves the names and goals of the top five players on Chelsea F.C., providing valuable insights for team strategy and performance analysis.

### 5. Summary:
In this lecture, we covered the essentials of querying data in Snowflake, including how to use the SELECT statement, filter results with WHERE, sort results with ORDER BY, and limit the number of results with LIMIT. Mastering these concepts is vital for your journey towards optimizing Python code and understanding databases better.

### 6. Next Steps:
In our next lecture, we will delve into more advanced querying techniques in Snowflake, including subqueries and common table expressions (CTEs). To prepare, review the SQL commands covered today and think about how they can be applied in real-world scenarios, especially in areas that interest you like sports analytics or video game statistics. This will help solidify your understanding and enhance your learning experience.
