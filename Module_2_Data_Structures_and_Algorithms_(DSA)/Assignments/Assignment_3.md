### Assignment: Player Performance Visualization Application

#### Problem Statement
Develop a Python application that visualizes player performance data using trees or graphs. The application should integrate real-world examples from basketball games or soccer matches, focusing on analyzing player statistics such as goals scored, assists, and defensive actions. The goal is to enhance understanding of how stacks and queues can be utilized to process and visualize data efficiently.

#### Starter Code
```python
from collections import deque
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Starter code for visualizing player performance data

class Player:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.goals = 0
        self.assists = 0
        self.defensive_actions = 0

    def update_stats(self, goals=0, assists=0, defensive_actions=0):
        self.goals += goals
        self.assists += assists
        self.defensive_actions += defensive_actions

def visualize_performance(players):
    # Step 1: Prepare data for visualization
    names = [player.name for player in players]
    goals = [player.goals for player in players]
    assists = [player.assists for player in players]
    
    # Step 2: Create a bar chart
    x = range(len(players))
    plt.bar(x, goals, width=0.4, label='Goals', color='blue', align='center')
    plt.bar([p + 0.4 for p in x], assists, width=0.4, label='Assists', color='orange', align='center')

    # Step 3: Add labels and title
    plt.xlabel('Players')
    plt.ylabel('Performance Stats')
    plt.title('Player Performance Visualization')
    plt.xticks([p + 0.2 for p in x], names)
    plt.legend()
    
    # Step 4: Show the plot
    plt.show()

# Test the function with sample data
players = [
    Player("Player A"),
    Player("Player B"),
    Player("Player C")
]

# Update player stats (students will need to implement this part)
players[0].update_stats(goals=3, assists=1)
players[1].update_stats(goals=1, assists=2)
players[2].update_stats(goals=2, defensive_actions=5)

# Visualize the performance of players
visualize_performance(players)
```

#### Detailed Instructions
1. **Step 1**: Implement a method in the `Player` class to update player statistics. This method should take parameters for goals, assists, and defensive actions.

2. **Step 2**: In the `visualize_performance` function, modify the code to include defensive actions in the visualization. Create a third bar in the chart to represent defensive actions alongside goals and assists.

3. **Step 3**: Enhance the output by adding grid lines to the chart for better readability and adjust the colors of the bars to improve visual distinction.

4. **Step 4**: Include an option to save the visualization as an image file (e.g., PNG) after displaying it.

5. **Step 5**: Write a brief report summarizing how stacks and queues could be applied in processing player actions during a game (e.g., using a queue to manage real-time statistics updates).

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation
- **Functionality**: The application should correctly visualize player performance data based on the updated statistics.
- **Code Quality**: The code should be clean, well-structured, and include comments explaining each section.
- **Visualization**: The bar chart must be clear, properly labeled, and visually appealing.
- **Report**: The report should effectively communicate the application of stacks and queues in the context of player performance analysis.

### Submission Guidelines
- Submit your completed Python script along with any images generated by the visualization.
- Include your report as a separate document or as comments within your code.
- Ensure your code runs without errors and adheres to best coding practices.

This assignment is designed to help you apply the concepts learned in the lecture on stacks and queues while connecting them to your interests in sports analytics, particularly in soccer and basketball. Good luck!
