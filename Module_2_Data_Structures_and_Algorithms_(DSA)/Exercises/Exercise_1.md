### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. Problem Statement
You are tasked with implementing a queue system to manage basketball game statistics for a local basketball league. This system will help track player performance during games, including points scored, assists, and rebounds. Your queue should allow you to enqueue new player stats as they occur during the game and dequeue them when you want to analyze or display the stats.

The queue should support the following operations:
- **Enqueue**: Add a player's stats to the queue when they score, assist, or rebound.
- **Dequeue**: Remove and display the stats of the player who has been waiting the longest in the queue.
- **Display**: Show all current player stats in the queue.

This exercise will help you apply your understanding of queues as discussed in Lecture 1: Introduction to Data Structures.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code

```python
# Starter code for implementing a queue system for basketball stats
class PlayerStatsQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []  # Initialize an empty list to store player stats

    def enqueue(self, player_name, points, assists, rebounds):
        # Add player's stats to the queue
        player_stats = {
            'name': player_name,
            'points': points,
            'assists': assists,
            'rebounds': rebounds
        }
        self.queue.append(player_stats)  # Add stats to the end of the queue

    def dequeue(self):
        # Remove and return the stats of the player at the front of the queue
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.queue.pop(0)  # Remove from front (FIFO)
        else:
            return None  # Return None if the queue is empty

    def is_empty(self):
        # Check if the queue is empty
        return len(self.queue) == 0

    def display(self):
        # Display all player stats in the queue
        for stats in self.queue:
            print(f"Player: {stats['name']}, Points: {stats['points']}, Assists: {stats['assists']}, Rebounds: {stats['rebounds']}")

# Example usage
basketball_stats = PlayerStatsQueue()
basketball_stats.enqueue("LeBron James", 30, 8, 10)
basketball_stats.enqueue("Dwyane Wade", 25, 5, 6)

# Display current stats
basketball_stats.display()

# Dequeue a player's stats
dequeued_stats = basketball_stats.dequeue()
print(f"Dequeued Stats: {dequeued_stats}")
```

#### 3. Hints
- **Hint 1**: Remember that a queue follows a First In First Out (FIFO) structure. Think about how you can implement this using a list in Python.
- **Hint 2**: When implementing the `enqueue` method, ensure that you are adding new player statistics to the end of your list.
- **Hint 3**: For the `dequeue` method, consider how you can remove the first element from your list and what should happen if there are no players in the queue.
- **Hint 4**: Utilize the `display` method to visualize all players currently waiting in the queue for their stats to be processed.

#### 4. Expected Outcome
By completing this exercise, you should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating an understanding of how queues work in programming. The final implementation should:
- Allow for adding player statistics dynamically as they occur during a game.
- Correctly remove and display player stats based on FIFO principles.
- Include error handling for cases when attempting to dequeue from an empty queue.
- Be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step, reinforcing your learning from Lecture 1.
