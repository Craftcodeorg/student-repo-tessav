### Module Title: Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

### Exercise Requirements

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   You are tasked with developing an algorithm to sort player scores from Valorant matches efficiently. The scores need to be processed in a way that allows for quick retrieval of the top players, similar to how you might analyze player performance in Premier League Soccer. This requires implementing a sorting algorithm that utilizes the principles of stacks and queues as discussed in Lecture 3. 

   **Scenario**: Imagine you are building an analytics dashboard for Chelsea F.C. to track player performance based on their scores in Valorant matches. You need to ensure that scores can be quickly sorted and retrieved for analysis, which can help in understanding player strategies and performance trends.

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**:
```python
from collections import deque

# Function to sort player scores using a queue
def sort_player_scores(scores):
    # Initialize a stack to hold sorted scores
    sorted_stack = []
    
    # Convert the input list to a queue for processing
    score_queue = deque(scores)
    
    while score_queue:
        # Get the current score from the front of the queue
        current_score = score_queue.popleft()
        
        # Place current_score in the correct position in sorted_stack
        while sorted_stack and sorted_stack[-1] > current_score:
            # Pop from stack if the top is greater than current_score
            score_queue.append(sorted_stack.pop())
        
        # Push current_score onto the stack
        sorted_stack.append(current_score)
    
    # Return sorted scores by popping from the stack
    return [sorted_stack.pop() for _ in range(len(sorted_stack))]

# Test the function with example scores
example_scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]
sorted_scores = sort_player_scores(example_scores)
print("Sorted Player Scores:", sorted_scores)
```

3. **Hints**:
   - Remember that a stack operates on a Last In First Out (LIFO) basis. Think about how you can use this property to maintain a sorted order.
   - When processing each score from the queue, consider how you can compare it with the scores already in the stack.
   - Use the `popleft()` method to access scores from the front of the queue efficiently, and `append()` to add back scores that need to be re-evaluated.

4. **Expected Outcome**:
   The student should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating an understanding of how stacks and queues can be applied to sorting algorithms. The final solution should adhere to best practices, include error handling for edge cases (e.g., empty lists), and be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step. The expected output for the provided example scores should correctly display the sorted list of player scores.

### Integration
- Ensure the exercise content is well-structured, with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform. Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links.
