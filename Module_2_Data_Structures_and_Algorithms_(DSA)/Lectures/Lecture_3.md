# Lecture: 3. Stacks and Queues: Implementation and Applications

### 1. Learning Objectives:
By the end of this lecture, learners will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of stacks and queues.
- Implement stacks and queues in Python.
- Identify real-world applications of these data structures, particularly in the context of Premier League Soccer analytics.
- Optimize code for performance using stacks and queues.

### 2. Introduction:
Stacks and queues are essential data structures in computer science that play a crucial role in algorithm design. A stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, while a queue adheres to the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Mastering these structures is vital for optimizing algorithms, particularly in fields like databases and artificial intelligence, where efficient data handling is crucial.

For a soccer enthusiast like yourself, think of a stack as a player who must wait for their turn to shoot on goal (LIFO), while a queue can represent the lineup of players waiting to enter the game (FIFO). Understanding these concepts will not only enhance your coding skills but also provide insights into how data structures can be applied in sports analytics, improving team strategies and player performance analysis.

### 3. Core Concepts:
#### Stacks:
- **Definition**: A stack is a collection of elements that supports push (adding an element) and pop (removing an element) operations.
- **Implementation**: In Python, a stack can be implemented using a list or the `collections.deque` module for optimized performance.
  
  ```python
  stack = []
  stack.append('Player A')  # Push
  stack.append('Player B')  # Push
  last_player = stack.pop()  # Pop - 'Player B'
  ```

#### Queues:
- **Definition**: A queue is a collection that allows adding elements at the back and removing elements from the front.
- **Implementation**: Similar to stacks, queues can be implemented using lists or `collections.deque`.
  
  ```python
  from collections import deque
  
  queue = deque()
  queue.append('Player A')  # Enqueue
  queue.append('Player B')  # Enqueue
  first_player = queue.popleft()  # Dequeue - 'Player A'
  ```

### 4. Practical Application:
In the context of Premier League Soccer, stacks can be used for managing player substitutions where the last player to enter is the first to leave. This is crucial during critical game moments where strategic substitutions can change the game's outcome.

Queues can be applied in scenarios such as processing player statistics during a match. For example, if you were to analyze player performance over time, you could maintain a queue of player actions (like shots on goal) to ensure that you process them in the order they occurred.

```python
# Example: Using a queue to track player actions
player_actions = deque()
player_actions.append('Shot on goal by Player A')
player_actions.append('Goal by Player B')
action = player_actions.popleft()  # Process actions in order
```

### 5. Summary:
In this lecture, we explored stacks and queues, their definitions, implementations in Python, and real-world applications in Premier League Soccer. Remember that mastering these data structures will enhance your ability to optimize algorithms and improve your coding efficiencyâ€”key skills for your career goals in DSA, databases, and AI technologies.

### 6. Next Steps:
In our next lecture, we will delve into **Linked Lists: Types and Applications**, where we will discuss how linked lists differ from arrays and their various use cases. To prepare, review the basics of arrays and lists discussed in the previous lectures, as this will provide a solid foundation for understanding linked lists.
